# Event Booking API

A backend API for event management and bookings built with **Node.js**, **Express**, and **PostgreSQL**.  
Supports authentication with **JWT**, secure password hashing, and seat-limited event booking with concurrency control.

---

##  Features
- User registration & login with JWT authentication.
- Password hashing with **bcryptjs**.
- Event management (CRUD) with seat limits.
- Secure booking system preventing overbooking using transactions.
- Protected routes (only event creators can edit their events).
- Pagination & date-based filtering for event listings.
- User-specific booking management (list & cancel).
- Tested against concurrent booking requests.
